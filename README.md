Hey, I'm Victor. I'm a sophomore in high school.

I'm interested in learning about applications of code, primarily Python, Java, and SQL. 

I'm currently learning the Python language, and looking to get myself more involved with with TensorFlow and OpenCV. In addition, I'm enrolled in the AP Computer Science course,
learning Java, and playing a part in my high school robotics club.

I'm looking to collaborate on learning projects and programs.

You can contact me at (425)-638-2138, by phone or text.
